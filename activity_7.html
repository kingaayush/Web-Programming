<h1>Aayush Purohit</h1> 
<h2>Adventure Lover</h2> 
<p> 
<img src="images/Aashu bhai.jpg" alt="Aayush's Image" /> Hi, 
my name is <b>Aayush Purohit</b>. I am 
<strong>excited</strong> to tell you about a place so close to my heart. 
<br> 
As I love <em>adventure</em> in my life, I jumped into almost every 
dangerous stuff as a kid. <br> 
Like, I used to <span class="custom-style">run around 
everywhere</span>, jump from higher places, hit my fellow mates after 
watching action movies, swim in lakes, and plan a sneak-out at midnight 
with cousins. 
</p> 
<p> 
So, let me take you to a place that I love the most in my world. <br> 
It's my grandma's home in <em>Udaipur</em>, Rajasthan. <br> 
<em>Udaipur</em> is known as the <em class="highlight">City of 
Lakes</em> in India. <br> 
It's a <strong>beautiful</strong> city. The Lakes, Mountains, 
Forests, Wildlife, and not to miss... <em>The Weather</em>, are 
amazing in <em>Udaipur</em>. <br> 
There is a lot to talk about the fun I have in <em>Udaipur</em>: 
trekking in mountains, swimming in lakes, making night-time Maggi with 
my cousins, watching horror movies at midnight, going cycling in the 
woods, long drives, and the list goes on... 
</p> 
 
<p> 
<em>Udaipur</em> is not just a city, it's a place that taught me so 
many things. <br> 
Learning values, building confidence, making new friends, 
leadership skills, being happy... almost every <strong>necessary 
skill</strong>. <br> 
So, this is about my world. <br> 
In my childhood, until I was in high school, once every year, my 
brother and I used to visit <em>Udaipur</em> during summer vacations. 
That time was <em>great</em>. I used to wait the whole year for this 
time. <br> 
Even now, when I am in college, I wait for the summer near June and 
July to visit <em>Udaipur</em> again and spend time there. <br> 
So, this was something I am very <strong>happy</strong> about.
