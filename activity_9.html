            <p style="font-family: Georgia, serif;">
                Hi, my name is <b>Aayush Purohit</b>. I am <strong>excited</strong> to tell you about a place so close to my heart. <br>
                As I love <em>adventure</em> in my life, I jumped into almost every dangerous stuff as a kid. <br>
                Like, I used to run around everywhere, jump from higher places, hitting my fellow mates after watching action movies when I was a kid, swimming in lakes, planning a sneak-out at midnight with cousins from our home, etc.
            </p>

        <div class="paragraph">
            <h2>My Favorite Place</h2>
            <p style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace;">
                So, let me take you to a place that I love the most in my world. <br>
                It's my grandma's home in <em>Udaipur</em>, Rajasthan. <br>
                <em>Udaipur</em> is known as the <em>City of Lakes</em> in India. <br>
                It's a <strong>beautiful</strong> city. The Lakes, Mountains, Forests, Wildlife, and not to miss... <em>The Weather</em>, are amazing in <em>Udaipur</em>. <br>
                There is a lot to talk about the fun I have in <em>Udaipur</em>: trekking in mountains, swimming in lakes, making night-time Maggi with my cousins, watching horror movies at midnight, going cycling in the woods, long drives, and the list goes on...

            <h2>What Udaipur Taught Me</h2>
            <p style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">
                <em>Udaipur</em> is not just a city, it's a place that taught me so many things. <br>
                Learning values, building confidence, making new friends, leadership skills, being happy... almost every <strong>necessary skill</strong>. <br>
                So, this is about my world. <br>
                In my childhood, until I was in high school, once every year, my brother and I used to visit <em>Udaipur</em> during summer vacations. That time was <em>great</em>. I used to wait the whole year for this time. <br>
                Even now, when I am in college, I wait for the summer near June and July to visit <em>Udaipur</em> again and spend time there. <br>
                So, this was something I am very <strong>happy</strong> about.
