        Hi, my name is <b>Aayush Purohit</b>. I am <strong>excited</strong> to tell you 
about a place so close to my heart. <br> 
        As I love <em>adventure</em> in my life, I jumped into almost every dangerous 
stuff as a kid. <br> 
        Like, I used to run around everywhere, jump from higher places, hitting my fellow 
mates after watching action movies when I was a kid, swimming in lakes, planning a 
sneak-out at midnight with cousins from our home, etc. 
    </p> 
 
    <p> 
        So, let me take you to a place that I love the most in my world. <br> 
        It's my grandma's home in <em>Udaipur</em>, Rajasthan. <br> 
        <em>Udaipur</em> is known as the <em class="highlight">City of Lakes</em> in 
India. <br> 
        It's a <strong>beautiful</strong> city. The Lakes, Mountains, Forests, Wildlife, and 
not to miss... <em>The Weather</em>, are amazing in <em>Udaipur</em>. <br> 
        There is a lot to talk about the fun I have in <em>Udaipur</em>: trekking in 
mountains, swimming in lakes, making night-time Maggi with my cousins, watching 
horror movies at midnight, going cycling in the woods, long drives, and the list goes on... 
    </p> 
 
    <p> 
        <em>Udaipur</em> is not just a city, it's a place that taught me so many things. 
<br> 
        Learning values, building confidence, making new friends, leadership skills, being 
happy... almost every <strong>necessary skill</strong>. <br> 
        So, this is about my world. <br> 
        In my childhood, until I was in high school, once every year, my brother and I used 
to visit <em>Udaipur</em> during summer vacations. That time was <em>great</em>. I 
used to wait the whole year for this time. <br> 
        Even now, when I am in college, I wait for the summer near June and July to visit 
<em>Udaipur</em> again and spend time there. <br> 
        So, this was something I am very <strong>happy</strong> about. 
    </p>
